  "I remember what the Internet was like before it was being watched, and
  there's never been anything in the history of man that's like it. I mean, you
  could have children from one part of the world having an equal discussion
  where you know they were sort of granted the same respect for their ideas and
  conversation, with experts in a field from another part of the world, on any
  topic, anywhere, anytime, all the time. And it was free and unrestrained." -

**RESONANCE: **  
As someone who grew up with a TRS-80, model 1, with a cassette tape boot loader, and a line printer (IBM Selectric II typewriter turned into a 7 CPS Line Printer) that my father build, my older brother and I learned about Bulletin Boards, and eventually hosted one out of the house. I remember the exploration of entirely new areas of interest, information that was free to be shared, asked, and answered, by a community of people that had their own opinions, and were happy to share them. 

**RESEARCH **  
As a pre-teen boy, when I was introduced to the capabilities of a computer, a bulletin board, and connected social communications, I found that it provided me a new way to learn about new things, from people around the world. I could ask someone in a different state, or different country, what it was like RIGHT NOW, and get an answer. This was a whole new avenue of research for me, and everyone else, as previous to these technologies, research was done at great expense, using massive libraries of information, and massive amounts of manpower to collect, collate, and organize. To utilize this research, you had to go to the library, find out more, ask more questions, and iterate. With a computer, modem & a bulletin board, you could post a question, and get several hundred answers, (depending on the community you belonged to) in hours! It was a research boon! In retrospect, it was also an intelligence goldmine, which is why we are now being used as the "product". But I digress.

When I read Edward Snowden's quote/statement above, I remember what it was like... I can remember these personal firsts very well:   
\* Computer purchase - too expensive, 286  
\* Portable computer - Compaq - Luggable  
\* Direct internet connection -Bellsouth DSL (IFIDL-Beta), 1997  
\* Laptop computer - Dell - 1999?  
and since then, it's a blur of equipment, technology, and scale. 

**RESPONSIBLE COMPUTING:**  
Today, I hold a phone in my hand that has orders of magnitudes of power compared to the first computer I used at home as a child. I recall the processes that were critical to maintaining, securing, protecting and utilizing this significant financial investment that my parents had made. Additionally, we wanted to ensure that we understood what data was stored where, and were very careful to never share personal information with people we didn't know. This was what we, in our family, called "Responsible computing".
